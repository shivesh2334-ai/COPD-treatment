# Clinical Workflow Guide

## Using the COPD Assessment & Treatment System

### Overview
This guide provides healthcare providers with a step-by-step workflow for using the COPD Assessment & Treatment System in clinical practice.

---

## 1. Pre-Visit Preparation

### Patient Selection
- **Confirmed or suspected COPD diagnosis**
- Post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC <0.70
- Age ≥40 years (typically)
- Smoking history or significant exposure to respiratory irritants

### Required Information
Before starting the assessment, gather:
- Recent spirometry results
- Medication history
- Exacerbation history (past 12 months)
- Recent laboratory results (CBC with differential)
- Chest imaging reports
- Comorbidity list

---

## 2. Patient Information Entry

### Demographics
1. Enter patient identifier (MRN or unique ID)
2. Record age, gender
3. Document smoking status:
   - Current smoker
   - Former smoker (quit date if known)
   - Never smoker
4. Calculate pack-years: `(packs per day) × (years smoked)`

### Medical History
1. Select all applicable comorbidities:
   - **Cardiovascular disease** - affects medication selection
   - **Diabetes** - monitor for steroid effects during exacerbations
   - **Asthma** - indicates possible ACO (Asthma-COPD Overlap)
   - **GERD** - may worsen symptoms
   - **Osteoporosis** - consider with ICS use
   
2. Document current medications
   - Include all COPD medications
   - Note adherence issues
   - Identify potential drug interactions

### Anthropometrics
- Height and weight for BMI calculation
- BMI <21 indicates malnutrition risk
- BMI is part of BODE index (if calculated)

---

## 3. Symptom Assessment

### Modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) Dyspnea Scale

**Ask the patient:** "Which statement best describes your breathlessness?"

| Grade | Description | Clinical Significance |
|-------|-------------|----------------------|
| 0 | No breathlessness except with strenuous exercise | Minimal functional limitation |
| 1 | Breathless when hurrying or walking up a slight hill | Mild functional limitation |
| 2 | Walks slower than people of same age OR has to stop for breath when walking at own pace | Moderate functional limitation |
| 3 | Stops for breath after walking about 100 meters or after a few minutes | Severe functional limitation |
| 4 | Too breathless to leave house or breathless when dressing | Very severe functional limitation |

**Clinical Interpretation:**
- Grades 0-1 = "Less symptomatic" (GOLD Group A or E)
- Grades 2-4 = "More symptomatic" (GOLD Group B or E)

### COPD Assessment Test (CAT)

**Instructions to patient:** "For each item, select the number that best describes you currently."

Administer all 8 questions:
1. Cough frequency (0=never, 5=all the time)
2. Mucus/phlegm (0=none, 5=chest full)
3. Chest tightness (0=not tight, 5=very tight)
4. Breathlessness with activity (0=none, 5=very breathless)
5. Activity limitations at home (0=not limited, 5=very limited)
6. Confidence leaving home (0=confident, 5=not confident)
7. Sleep quality (0=soundly, 5=poorly)
8. Energy level (0=lots, 5=none)

**Scoring:**
- Total = Sum of all responses (0-40)
- <10 = Low impact
- 10-20 = Medium impact
- 21-30 = High impact
- 31-40 = Very high impact

**Clinical Interpretation:**
- CAT <10 = "Less symptomatic" (GOLD Group A or E)
- CAT ≥10 = "More symptomatic" (GOLD Group B or E)

**Note:** Either mMRC ≥2 OR CAT ≥10 qualifies as "more symptomatic"

---

## 4. Exacerbation History Assessment

### Definition of Exacerbation
An acute worsening of respiratory symptoms requiring additional treatment.

### Severity Classification

| Severity | Definition | Treatment |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| **Mild** | Managed with SABA only | SABA increase |
| **Moderate** | Requires antibiotics and/or systemic corticosteroids | Antibiotics ± prednisone |
| **Severe** | Requires hospitalization or ED visit | Hospital/ED care |

### Questions to Ask

1. **"In the past 12 months, how many times did you need antibiotics or prednisone (oral steroids) for your COPD?"**
   - Record number of moderate exacerbations
   
2. **"In the past 12 months, were you hospitalized or did you go to the emergency department for your COPD?"**
   - Record if yes (severe exacerbation)
   - Note frequency if multiple

### Clinical Significance
- **0 exacerbations** = Low risk (Group A or B)
- **≥1 moderate or severe exacerbation** = High risk (Group E)
- History of exacerbations is the best predictor of future exacerbations

---

## 5. Spirometry Interpretation

### Key Measurements

**Post-bronchodilator values (30 minutes after bronchodilator):**

1. **FEV1** (Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second)
   - Measured in liters
   - Compare to predicted value

2. **FVC** (Forced Vital Capacity)
   - Total volume exhaled
   - Measured in liters

3. **FEV1/FVC Ratio**
   - Diagnostic threshold: <0.70 confirms airflow obstruction
   - Lower ratios indicate more severe obstruction

### GOLD Spirometric Classification

| GOLD Stage | FEV1 % Predicted | Severity |
|------------|------------------|----------|
| **GOLD 1** | ≥80% | Mild |
| **GOLD 2** | 50-79% | Moderate |
| **GOLD 3** | 30-49% | Severe |
| **GOLD 4** | <30% | Very Severe |

### Important Notes
- Spirometry determines airflow limitation severity
- GOLD stage is NOT used for initial treatment decisions (ABE groups are)
- Spirometry is used for diagnosis confirmation and monitoring
- Repeat annually or when clinically indicated

---

## 6. Laboratory Evaluation

### Blood Eosinophil Count

**Clinical Significance:**
- Predicts response to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)
- Guide decisions about adding ICS to bronchodilator therapy

| Eosinophil Count | ICS Benefit | Clinical Action |
|------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **<100 cells/μL** | Minimal | Avoid ICS (increased pneumonia risk) |
| **100-299 cells/μL** | Moderate | Consider ICS if frequent exacerbations |
| **≥300 cells/μL** | High | Strong consideration for ICS |

**Notes:**
- Check eosinophils when NOT on systemic steroids
- Single measurement generally sufficient
- Eosinophils can vary; if borderline, recheck

### Other Laboratory Tests
- **CBC**: Screen for polycythemia, anemia
- **Alpha-1 antitrypsin**: If age <45 or strong family history
- **Arterial blood gas**: If GOLD 3-4 or concern for hypoxemia/hypercapnia

---

## 7. Chest Imaging Review

### Chest X-ray Findings Suggestive of COPD

**Hyperinflation:**
- Flattened diaphragm (on lateral view)
- Increased retrosternal airspace
- >10 posterior ribs visible above diaphragm

**Other Findings:**
- Bullae (large air spaces)
- Attenuated pulmonary vasculature
- Narrow cardiac silhouette (vertical heart)
- Bronchial wall thickening

**Important:**
- CXR may be normal in mild COPD
- CXR helps exclude alternative diagnoses (pneumonia, masses, effusions)
- Consider CT chest if diagnostic uncertainty or evaluating for emphysema/bronchiectasis

---

## 8. GOLD Group Determination

### Classification Algorithm

```
Start Here
│
├─► Exacerbations in past year?
│   │
│   ├─► ≥1 moderate or severe → GROUP E (High Risk)
│   │
│   └─► 0 exacerbations → Check Symptoms
│       │
│       ├─► mMRC ≥2 OR CAT ≥10 → GROUP B (More Symptomatic, Low Risk)
│       │
│       └─► mMRC 0-1 AND CAT <10 → GROUP A (Less Symptomatic, Low Risk)
```

### Group Definitions

**Group A:**
- mMRC 0-1 AND CAT <10
- No exacerbations in past year
- Treatment: Single long-acting bronchodilator (LAMA preferred)

**Group B:**
- mMRC ≥2 OR CAT ≥10
- No exacerbations in past year
- Treatment: Dual bronchodilator (LAMA-LABA)

**Group E:**
- ≥1 moderate or severe exacerbation in past year
- Treatment: LAMA-LABA (consider ICS based on eosinophils)

---

## 9. Treatment Selection

### Group A: Less Symptomatic, Low Risk

**First-line:** Single long-acting bronchodilator
- **Preferred:** LAMA (better exacerbation protection)
  - Tiotropium 18 mcg once daily OR 2.5 mcg (2 inh) once daily
  - Umeclidinium 62.5 mcg once daily
  - Glycopyrrolate 50 mcg once daily
  
- **Alternative:** LABA (if LAMA not tolerated)
  - Salmeterol 50 mcg twice daily
  - Formoterol 20 mcg twice daily
  - Olodaterol 2.5 mcg (2 inh) once daily

**Rescue:** SABA (albuterol 2 puffs as needed)

### Group B: More Symptomatic, Low Risk

**First-line:** Dual bronchodilator (LAMA-LABA)
- Tiotropium-Olodaterol 2.5/2.5 mcg, 2 inh once daily (SMI)
- Umeclidinium-Vilanterol 62.5/25 mcg once daily (DPI)
- Glycopyrrolate-Formoterol 9/4.8 mcg, 2 inh twice daily (MDI)
- Aclidinium-Formoterol 400/12 mcg once daily (DPI)

**Alternative:** Single LAMA if dual therapy not available/tolerated

**Rescue:** SABA or SABA-SAMA combination

**Special Consideration:**
- If asthma-COPD overlap suspected → consider adding ICS

### Group E: High Risk of Exacerbations

**Decision Point: Blood Eosinophils**

#### Eosinophils <100 cells/μL
**Treatment:** LAMA-LABA (avoid ICS)
- Same options as Group B
- Avoid ICS due to increased pneumonia risk with minimal benefit

#### Eosinophils 100-299 cells/μL
**Initial:** LAMA-LABA
- Reassess after 3-6 months
- If persistent exacerbations → consider adding ICS

#### Eosinophils ≥300 cells/μL
**Treatment:** Consider triple therapy (LAMA-LABA-ICS)
- Umeclidinium-Vilanterol-Fluticasone (single inhaler)
- Alternative: LAMA + LABA-ICS combination

**Special Situations:**
1. **Recent hospitalization** → Triple therapy regardless of eosinophils
2. **≥2 moderate exacerbations** → Strong consideration for triple therapy
3. **Asthma-COPD overlap** → Triple therapy preferred

**Rescue:** SABA

## 10. Patient Education

### Inhaler Technique Training

**Demonstrate and have patient return-demonstrate:**

1. **MDI (Metered Dose Inhaler):**
   - Shake 5 times
   - Exhale fully away from inhaler
   - Close lips around mouthpiece
   - Actuate while beginning slow inhalation (3-5 seconds)
   - Hold breath 10 seconds
   - Wait 30-60 seconds between puffs
   - Recommend spacer for most patients

2. **DPI (Dry Powder Inhaler):**
   - Do not shake
   - Load dose (method varies by device)
   - Exhale fully away from device
   - Close lips around mouthpiece
   - Inhale quickly and deeply
   - Hold breath 10 seconds

3. **SMI (Soft Mist Inhaler):**
   - Turn base to load dose
   - Exhale fully
   - Close lips around mouthpiece
   - Press button while inhaling slowly
   - Hold breath 10 seconds

### Medication Counseling

**Key Points:**
- Difference between maintenance (daily) and rescue (as-needed) medications
- Expected timeline for improvement (1-2 weeks for symptoms, 3-6 months for exacerbations)
- Importance of daily adherence even when feeling well
- How to recognize and manage exacerbations early
- Side effects to watch for and when to call

### Action Plan

Provide written action plan including:
- Daily medications with schedule
- Rescue medication use
- Signs of exacerbation:
  - Increased breathlessness
  - Increased cough
  - Increased sputum volume or color change
- When to call clinic vs. go to ED
- Emergency contact numbers
